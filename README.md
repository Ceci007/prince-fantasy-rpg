# About 

This demo shows how collision detection can be implemented based on not only the collision itself but distance during the collision and direction of the object facing. And also how an API can be used to store players data. In the demo you get points when you hit the "punching bag" slime. To exit you can just press the ESC key and submit your score.

This is a demo for physics implementation, events and scene reloading/handling. Don't expect a full game.
